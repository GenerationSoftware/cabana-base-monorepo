### Known Issues / Fixes

When adding/updating apps and/or packages, duplicate dependencies may be created, creating versioning issues. This can be resolved through running `pnpm up -r` as described [here](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2443), or just looking through `pnpm-lock.yaml` to identify version discrepancies.

The biggest culprit of the above is `@tanstack/react-query`, which sometimes is installed as two different versions and apps can no longer utilize hooks from the hooks package. This has been solved through the method described [here](https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/3595#issuecomment-1248074333).

If editing component themes in `ui`, having the `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense` plugin for VSCode is recommended. In order to enable it for custom Flowbite themes and string class names, add `theme` and `.*ClassName*` to the `Class Attributes` setting.

Currently, `lottie-react` has some SSR issues in Node v22 as seen [here](https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react/issues/101). Downgrading your node version to v18 resolves this issue.
